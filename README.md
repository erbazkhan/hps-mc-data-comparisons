# HPS MC ↔ Data Comparisons (MiniDST)

This project contains a small, focused workflow to compare **HPS MiniDST** Monte Carlo and real data using **ROOT RDataFrame (PyROOT)**.

The goal is to build sanity-check plots and validation comparisons such as:
- Reco-level distributions (MC vs Data)
- Truth vs reco (inside MC)
- Electron/positron kinematics
- ECAL energy
